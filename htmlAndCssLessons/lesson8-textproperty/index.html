    <h1>CSS - Cascading Style Sheets</h1>


    <div>
        <p>
            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing
            the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML
            or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS is a
            cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
            JavaScript. CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and
            presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can
            improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the
            specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages
            to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css
            file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content;
            and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed
            between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
          </p>
      
      
          <p>
            Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the
            same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such
            as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen
            reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for
            alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]

            The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine
            which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular
            element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable. The CSS
            specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
            Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by
            RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for
            CSS documents.
